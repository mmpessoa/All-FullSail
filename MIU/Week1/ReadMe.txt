Instructions
Watch the attached video, which introduces the Feature, Search, Browse design pattern and gives examples using popular mobile web sites and apps.Your first project is to convert your data management application from your Visual Frameworks course to exhibit this design pattern. This means that you will need to redesign and refactor your main (home) page to include the following elements:
¥	Feature: This element should be a large, attractive section, containing a graphic, a brief description or value proposition, and an appropriate signifier that collectively function as a Call-to-Action. This grouping should be designed to entice users to click-through and perform some action within your application. In a mobile context, the graphic in this grouping is most commonly sized to fit to the width of the screen, while still visually grouped with the description or value proposition and signifier in close proximity to the graphic. This allows users to visually associate the elements as a single Featured item. Lastly, this Feature will typically be your most recent entry, providing users with new and fresh content.
¥	Search: This element should be an input text box with a clearly labeled search button. The surrounding text or other design elements should make it clear that this text box performs a global search.
¥	Browse: This section should include a number of organized links to the categories available in your application. Commonly, this section contains all of the categories to make it easier for users to find what they want, but can contain only a subset of items if it makes sense for your application.
¥	Titled Sections: Related items should be grouped into sections, and every section should include a clear title. This organization helps your users quickly understand the flow at a glance.
¥	Generous Borders: This pattern is especially important on mobile devices, where it can be difficult to accurately interact with elements that are too close together, or too close to the edge of the screen.What should it look like?
You will find that design patterns are not about producing a single result, to make apps that all look the same. As you watched the video, you saw that different mobile web sites and apps implemented this pattern in different ways. You have that same freedom to implement the pattern how you feel it best fits your app.
Part of your job for this project is to stop and think about how your users will most commonly interact with your app. Is the most important feature the Search, like Amazon, such that it should be positioned above the Feature? Or maybe your users mostly prefer to Browse, like Target. In your reflection video for this project you will need to justify why you implemented this pattern the way you did.
When talking about interaction design, the Why? question is almost always more important than the How? question. Take the time to think through your choices.
Part of your grade for this project is the thoroughness of your justification of why you did what you did.
Hints
When you refactor your HTML for this project you should consider grouping each logical section into its own block-level element, such as elements. As you move forward into the class and later projects this will enable you to quickly implement upcoming patterns.
The Titled Sections requirement can be met in a number of ways, but your best bet is to stick with a semantic solution. Remember from your Visual Frameworks course that semantic elements have structural meaning, and use tags like instead of.
Satisfying the Generous Borders requirement should be as easy as a few minor modifications to your stylesheet. Don't make it more complicated than that. If it takes more than a few minutes, you may want to consider refactoring your HTML, as it would imply that your organization may need some work.
To ensure that I can see how well you've implemented these patterns, especially the Browse requirement, make sure that your application includes dummy data for at least 20 items in at least 5 categories. The dummy data should not include lorem ipsum or other nonsense filler. The items should be consistent with and appropriate for the theme of your application.
Deliverables
As in previous courses, you will be using Git and GitHub to track your changes. Push your commits to GitHub and remember to push a working version to your gh-pages branch so that it can be seen live. You will need to include two live links to your code. Use the Link feature of the post box to make sure that your links are live (clickable), as there will be a point deduction if they are not.

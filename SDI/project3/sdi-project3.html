<article>
<p>My project's theme is an exploration of the process of purchasing a new puppy.</p>
<p>I am interested in purebred dogs such as Corgis, Dachshunds and French Bulldogs, but I'm also considering crossbred dogs such as the Mini-Walrus (a Shar-Pei / Bassett Hound mix) or a Mini Bulldog (an English Bulldog / Boston Terrier mix). I am not interested in purchasing a large dog -- small or medium is fine. The dog needs to have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, and it needs to be female. The budget for the puppy is $2,000. </p>

Project 3 requirements:

For your project you are required to have at least some JSON data. Since JSON is a subset of JavaScript literal values, even a single variable of any type is technically JSON. However, for the purpose of this project, the JSON requirement is as follows:
The top level (outermost) data type must be an object or array.
There must be at least two levels of additional types beneath the top level type, for a total of at least 3 levels of data. That is, you may have an object that has an array of objects, or an object with an array of arrays, or an array with objects within objects, etc.
At the innermost level you will have the primitive data types: strings, numbers, and booleans.
For example, I might have a pirate object, with a ships array property, where each item was an object with properties such as shipName, cargoSpace, etc. There are three levels (pirate→ships→ship) and primitive data at the lowest level.


For your project you have been given a number of flowchart elements without connectors between them. As you write your code to create a cohesive application out of those basic parts, you will also need to create a flowchart that represents your code by including those building blocks along with the connectors and annotations necessary to make a sensible chart.


Your project does not require any private properties or methods, nor do you need to follow the module pattern in your code. 

This assignment is in 3 parts: JavaScript code, Google Drawing flowchart, and Git repository.
You are open to code any story you want, as long as you can use (at least) all of the elements in that flowchart. Don't worry if some of the symbols are new—they will be covered in this week's activities.
This part of the assignment is graded on your syntax, coding style, functionality, and feature completeness. You may refactor your Deliverable 1 or Deliverable 2 code, so you don't have to start fresh. You may reuse your theme, or come up with a new one.

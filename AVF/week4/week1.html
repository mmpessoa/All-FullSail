                        the data as a JSON object on a different site.                  </p>

                      <p>The notifications and contacts are a natural pairing with the Twitter
                        or Tumblr APIs. An alert or breaking news from your app can be sent to
                        selected people in Contacts. The camera and geolocation pair well together
                        with APIs that have a “check in” social component, like FourSquare or a
                        photo feature such as the Flickr or Instagram APIs.                  </p>

                        into my “Cryptid Keeper” app. The app is supposed to allow the user to
                        record the sighting of a cryptid, like a sasquatch, or chupacabra, so the
                        features I mentioned would fit well.                  </p>

                      <p>The number one lesson learned for me is to manage my time so that I can
                        ask questions before the assignment is due. I research apps by searching
                        through the iTunes store for apps with similar functionality so I can get
                        a sense of what features potential competitors are offering. </p>
                      <p>Sometimes I come up with a design by taking screen captures of interfaces
                        I like and rearranging them in Photoshop, and sometimes I just sketch out
                        my ideas on paper with markers. If I’m stuck, I look at the O’Reilly mobile
                        design patterns book to remind myself of industry-standard best practices.                    </p>
                      <p>I hate flow charts, so I don’t bother with that anymore. Instead I make
                        storyboards to work out the interactivity and workflow. </p>

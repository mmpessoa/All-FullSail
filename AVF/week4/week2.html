                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong><em>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo
                      app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can use the Section tag with
                      jQuery, for instance) </em></strong> </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p> There are four disability areas that can be addressed with HTML5 features.
                        For the hearing impaired, I can provide text alternatives to alert sound
                        or subtitles for video content. </p>
                      <p> Mobility problems are harder to address. I would have to make sure that
                        clickable links can be triggered by the keyboard or mouse, and not by touch
                        alone. Also, there shouldn’t be any time limits to input information, and
                        content cannot auto-refresh. Users with mobility problems need more time
                        to complete tasks. There’s also the possibility of using voice recognition
                        to advance through menus, but that’s way beyond my current skillset. </p>
                      <p> Cognitive difficulties can be addressed as well. If I want a webpage/app
                        to make sense to a six-year-old, a semi-literate adult, or someone that
                        speaks English as a second language, I would focus on clear, legible icons
                        and simple sans-serif fonts. I’d avoid technical jargon, slang or idioms
                        that might confuse a non-mainstream user. </p>
                      <p> The solution for visual problems combines some of the solutions above.
                        Legibility will help both the cognitively disabled and the visually impaired.
                        Contrast between text and background can be fixed without special tools,
                        and there are online tools that can scan a site and flag areas where the
                        colors would cause issues for those with different types of colorblindness. </p>

                    <p> <em><strong> Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen

                      (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are
                      given - how could you fix them (or use them)? </strong> </em></p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p> The main problems that I saw in the demos I viewed (<a href="https://vimeo.com/8369435" target="_blank" data-mce-href="https://vimeo.com/8369435">https://vimeo.com/8369435 </a> ,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZtCjS1Yz1g" target="_blank" data-mce-href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZtCjS1Yz1g"> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZtCjS1Yz1g </a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZKLPMsb2g0" target="_blank" data-mce-href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZKLPMsb2g0"> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZKLPMsb2g0</a>), were lack of control over the speed of the spoken text, different voices
                        and accents being used in the same sentence and mispronunciations of words,
                        inability to control the size of text or color contrast in apps other than
                        default system apps. The only problem that I think I could fix is to make
                        sure that any images I use are accurately annotated with ALT tags that
                        screen readers can speak. Links can also be given names and IDs that directly
                        relate to their function – i.e. “Submit Form” instead of “Click Me,” or
                        something like that. <br>

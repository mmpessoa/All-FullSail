                    <h2><strong>Week 3 Discussion: Market Research
                    </strong></h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong><em>What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.? Japan? Great Britain?
                      </em></strong></p>
                    <p>For iOS, the information is as follows ("itunes store rss,"):
                      
                      With the exception of WhatsApp Messenger, nine of the top ten paid apps in the U.S. are games. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/toppaidapplications/limit=10/xml" target="new">https://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/toppaidapplications/limit=10/xml </a></p>
                    <p>In Japan, the top paid apps are very different. There are two language translators, a manga reader, an app that tweaks the iOS UI, a photo app and three games (Final Fantasy and Grand Theft Auto).
                      
                      <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/jp/rss/toppaidapplications/limit=10/xml" target="new">https://itunes.apple.com/jp/rss/toppaidapplications/limit=10/xml </a></p>
                    <p>In the UK, seven of the top ten paid apps are games. The exceptions are WhatsApp Messenger, iPNP 2012 (a Santa messenger – not quite a game, but close) and Adrian James Boot Camp, a fitness app.
                      
                      <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/rss/toppaidapplications/limit=10/xml" target="new">https://itunes.apple.com/gb/rss/toppaidapplications/limit=10/xml </a></p>
                    <p>For Android, only one non-game app, FoxFi (a hotspot app) is in the top 25 on the highest grossing list in the US by Google’s internal ranking. ("Top grossing apps," 2012)
                      
                      <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/topgrossing?hl=en" target="new">https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/topgrossing?hl=en </a></p>
                    <p>However, an independent ranking firm, AppData.com, shows only three games – MineCraft, Wreck-It Ralph and Where’s My Water – in the top fifteen. ("Android appdata," 2012)
                      
                      </p>
                    <p>In the UK, 68 of the top 100 Android apps are “freemium” games. (Dredge, 2012)
                      <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2012/apr/20/android-top-grossing-apps" target="new">http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2012/apr/20/android-top-grossing-apps</a> </p>
                    <p>I was unable to find Android app statistics for the Japanese market.
                      
                      </p>
                    <p><strong><em>Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?
                      
                      </em></strong></p>
                    <p>The Japanese market is the most diverse, at least under iOS. A productivity app can rise to the top in Japan, but apparently users are only interested in the most well established game franchises. In both the US and the UK, users are most interested in entertainment.
                      
                      </p>
                    <p><strong><em>What are the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact development?
                      
                      </em></strong></p>
                    <p>In the UK, a typical iPhone plan costs £26 and gives the user unlimited minutes, unlimited texts, and 1 GB of data. ("Top ten phone contract," 2012)
                      
                      </p>
                    <p>In the US, a typical iPhone plan with the same specs costs $79.99. ("Compare cell phone," 2012) I was unable to find comparative data for Japanese cellphone contracts.
                      
                      </p>
                    <p>From what I can gather, bandwidth constraints are a decreasing constraint. Competition continues to drive down costs. Still, as good designers we should strive to make our apps as streamlined, small and efficient as possible.                      </p>
                    <p><strong><em>And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.                      </em></strong></p>
                    <p>The premise of this exercise is that a firm has asked a consultant to make a recommendation about what type of app to build. Based on the above research, if they want to make the top-ten list in the US market for iTunes, they need to make a game app.                      </p>
                    <p>However, this seems like an unlikely scenario. It seems much more likely that a firm would start by deciding they need an app to promote their company, then bring in a consultant to make it happen. The market segment of the business would dictate what type of app makes sense for them. For example, I can’t imagine that Avon would bring a consultant in and ask him/her if they should make a perfume game, or make an app from which the user could order their products.                      </p>
